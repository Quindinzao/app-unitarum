Hello dear traveller, how are you?

This is my app I'm making myself...
    I still want to add a database to it 
    and turn it into a really serious project.

Well, this project was done in TS and I always do
    a yarn install before running it on my devices 
    or emulators. I recommend you do the same.

Sorry for my poor English and that's it :)
